# PHP Contrib

Welcome to PHP Contrib!

PHP Contrib was created to provide a platform to discover and contribute community-driven recommendations and interfaces.

PHP Contrib was not created as a replacement but rather a complement to the important work of [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/).

## How does PHP Contrib complement PHP-FIG?

- Projects using the contributed recommendations or interfaces will provide valuable insight on usability and practicality of proposals and candidates.
- Projects can use contributed interfaces without having to wait for the [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) to be accepted.

## How does PHP Contrib benefit projects?

Some projects may prefer to use interfaces that are not tied to a framework or project.

## How can I contribute

1. Submit a [request for membership](https://github.com/orgs/php-contrib/discussions/categories/membership-request). Create a repository with your recommendation or interface.
1. Start a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/php-contrib/discussions).
